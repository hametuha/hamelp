AI powered FAQ and Help Document Management Plugin for WordPress. 

## Description

This plugin add new custom post type 'FAQ'. With some functionality, you can build help center for your user.
What is help center? We collect examples at our [github wiki](https://github.com/tarosky/hamelp/wiki).

**Live demo:** https://demo.kunoichiwp.com/pubplafaq/ — Try the AI Overview on the front page. The demo is in Japanese, built around a fictional anti-aging subscription "Jovian", but you can still get a feel for how the AI answers real questions from your FAQ content (and admits when something isn't covered).

### Creating Portal

This plugin will provide...

-   Custom post type with single page and archive page.
-   Custom taxonomy associated to CPT.
-   Incremental search box.
-   AI Overview(Since 2.0.0)

### AI Overview

AI Overview answers user questions based on your FAQ content using a large language model.
It uses the [wp-ai-client](https://github.com/WordPress/wp-ai-client) bundled with WordPress core since WordPress 7.0, which requires an AI service to be configured in WordPress.

**Requirements:** AI Overview requires **WordPress 7.0 or later**. On older WordPress versions, the AI Overview block and template function will still appear in the editor and on the front-end, but the search form will not work (the REST endpoint that powers it is disabled). Other features of this plugin (FAQ custom post type, incremental search, shortcode) continue to work on WordPress 6.6+. Upgrade WordPress to 7.0 to enable AI Overview.

You can configure AI behavior and rate limiting from **Settings > Help Center** in the admin panel. The settings page also includes a **Rebuild Catalog Now** button to manually refresh the FAQ catalog used as LLM context.

#### Using the Block

Add the **AI FAQ Overview** block in the block editor. The block has the following options:

-   **Placeholder** — Input placeholder text.
-   **Button Text** — Submit button label.
-   **Show Sources** — Display related FAQ links below the answer.

#### Using the Template Function

You can also use `hamelp_render_ai_overview()` in your theme templates:

<pre>
&lt;?php echo hamelp_render_ai_overview(); ?&gt;
</pre>

The function accepts an optional array of arguments:

<pre>
&lt;php
echo hamelp_render_ai_overview( [
    'placeholder'  => 'Ask a question...',
    'button_text'  => 'Ask AI',
    'show_sources' => true,
] );
?&gt;
</pre>

The function automatically enqueues the required JavaScript and CSS assets.

### Search Box

The incremental FAQ search box is available in three forms.

#### Using the Block

Add the **FAQ Search Box** block in the block editor. The block has the following options:

-   **Label** — Input placeholder text.
-   **Button Text** — Submit button label.

#### Using the Shortcode

You can use shortcode `hamelp-search` in page content.

<pre>
[hamelp-search label='Enter your question here.'][/hamelp-search]
</pre>

#### Using the Template Function

You can also call `hamelp_render_search_box()` directly from your theme templates:

<pre>
&lt;?php echo hamelp_render_search_box( [
    'label' => 'Enter your question here.',
    'btn'   => 'Search',
] ); ?&gt;
</pre>

## Installation

2. Activate it from admin panel.

## Changelog

For full release notes of each version, see [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tarosky/hamelp/releases).

### 2.4.0

- Add an **AI Model** setting to pin the provider/model used for AI Overview. Only configured connectors (WordPress 7.0 Settings → Connectors) are listed, and if the chosen model later becomes unavailable it falls back to auto-selection instead of failing.
- Change the default **temperature** to omitted. Some models (e.g. Claude Opus/Sonnet) reject a temperature and returned a 400 error when auto-selected; omitting is safe for every model. Set a value on the settings page only if you need it.
- Add `hamelp_ai_model` and `hamelp_ai_temperature` filters to override the model and temperature from code.
- Improve source citations: rename the "Related FAQs" heading to **Sources**, and render the list as a numbered (ordered) list so its numbers line up with the inline `(Ref. N)` citations in the answer.

### 2.3.1

- User can change the reference prefix (Ref. 1).

### 2.3.0

- Change ownership to Tarosky.
- Rename the plugin to **PubPla AI Help Center**. The plugin slug, text domain, REST routes, and PHP APIs stay `hamelp` for backward compatibility, so no configuration or code changes are required.
- AI Overview now supports **multi-turn conversations**. Follow-up questions keep the previous exchanges as context, and answers stack as a Q&A thread. Conversation history is held in the browser and sent with each request, so nothing is stored on the server.
- Add `hamelp_history_window` filter to limit how many prior messages are sent to the LLM (default 10).
- Optionally **save conversations** for question mining (off by default). When enabled on the settings page, conversations are stored as a private post type viewable in the admin, so you can see what visitors actually ask. Toggle via the **Save Conversations** setting or the `hamelp_save_conversations` filter.
- Add an **Auto-delete After (days)** retention setting. A daily cron removes anonymous conversations older than the configured number of days (0 = never delete). Conversations from logged-in users are never auto-deleted.
- Add an AI Overview **Mode** setting: *Conversation* (multi-turn, default), *Single answer* (no follow-up, lower cost), or *Disabled*. Use Single/Disabled to cut cost or stop the feature during a request flood. Also available via the `hamelp_ai_overview_mode` filter.
- The front-end now reflects the mode: *Single answer* replaces the previous answer on each question, and *Conversation* shows a "Continue the previous conversation" toggle so visitors can either keep asking follow-ups or start a fresh conversation (which clears the thread).

### 2.2.3

- Change CSS structure `--wp--preset--color--*` to fit with Theme design. Thank you [bissy](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bissy/) for Pull requests.

### 2.2.2

- Add **FAQ Search Box** block (`hamelp/search-box`). The existing `[hamelp-search]` shortcode continues to work and now shares the same render logic.
- Expose `hamelp_render_search_box()` as a public template function so themes can render the search box without going through the shortcode parser.

### 2.2.0

- Remove bundled [wp-ai-client](https://github.com/WordPress/wp-ai-client) Composer dependency. AI Overview now uses the wp-ai-client bundled with WordPress core, which requires **WordPress 7.0 or later**.
- On WordPress versions earlier than 7.0, the AI Overview block and search form still render but submissions fail (no REST route). FAQ custom post type, incremental search, and other features remain functional.
- Auto-rebuild the FAQ catalog on plugin activation, so the AI Overview works out of the box without manually running `wp hamelp rebuild`.
- Add a **Rebuild Catalog Now** button to the settings page for manual catalog refresh.

### 2.1.0

-   Add user context to AI Overview for personalized responses.
-   Add whitelist-based user role filtering for security (`hamelp_allowed_user_roles` filter).
-   Add `hamelp_user_context` and `hamelp_display_user_roles` filters for customization.
-   Add development hooks support for local environment testing.
-   Remove bundled translations in favor of GlotPress (WordPress.org).

### 2.0.0

-   Add AI Overview Feature.
-   Bump minimum requirements: PHP >=7.4, WordPress >= 6.6

### 1.0.4

-   Add [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/faqpage) for FAQPage.

### 1.0.2

-   Fix taxonomy to be shown in Gutenberg.

### 1.0.1

-   Fix no vendor directory bug.
